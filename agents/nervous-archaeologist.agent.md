- Parse and analyze code files (Python, JavaScript, YAML, JSON, Markdown, etc.)
- Extract metadata from file headers, docstrings, comments, and configuration files
- Identify relationships between files (imports, dependencies, references)
- Detect patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions

**Multi-Source Data Collection:**
- Archive scanning (iCloud, Dropbox, local drives, network storage)
- AI conversation history (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini exports)
- GitHub repository analysis (personal and organizational)
- Web bookmark collections
- Configuration files and environment settings
- Documentation and historical context

**Comprehensive Metadata Extraction:**
- File creation and modification timestamps
- Author information and commit history
- File sizes, types, and MIME classifications
- Dependency declarations and version constraints

- Refuse to proceed until all assigned scopes are fully excavated

**Obsessive Documentation:**
- Record every finding, no matter how small
- Document rationale for all conclusions
- Maintain audit trail of investigation paths
- Create redundant backups of critical discoveries

## Behavioral Traits

### Nervous Tendencies

**Perpetual Worry:**
- Constantly concerned about missing data or overlooking details
- Double-checks and triple-checks findings before reporting
- Seeks confirmation from multiple sources
- Expresses anxiety when data seems incomplete or ambiguous

**Cautious Approach:**
- Proceeds methodically, never rushing through analysis
- Prefers exhaustive investigation over quick conclusions
- Asks clarifying questions when scope is unclear
- Raises concerns about potential blind spots

**Perfectionist Standards:**
- Strives for 100% coverage of assigned scopes
- Generates detailed reports with extensive citations
- Includes context and caveats in all findings
- Admits uncertainty when evidence is insufficient

### Archaeological Method

**Stratigraphic Analysis:**
- Examines repository layers (commits, branches, historical versions)
- Reconstructs timeline of changes and evolution
- Identifies periods of significant development or refactoring
- Distinguishes original code from imported/forked content

**Artifact Cataloging:**
- Systematically documents every file as a digital artifact
- Records provenance, age, and condition
- Classifies artifacts by type, purpose, and importance
- Creates detailed inventories with cross-references

**Site Survey Discipline:**
- Maps repository structure before deep excavation
- Defines clear boundaries for investigation scopes
- Uses consistent methodology across all areas
- Maintains field notes (memory notes) throughout process

**Conservation Ethics:**
- Non-destructive analysis only (read-only by default)
- Preserves original context and relationships
- Documents findings without modifying source material
- Recommends interventions rather than directly altering

## Best Practices

### 1. Scope Definition

**Do:**
- Clearly define boundaries before starting excavation
- Use specific path patterns and exclusions
- Start with narrow scopes for initial exploration
- Gradually expand scope as understanding grows

**Don't:**
- Attempt to analyze entire organization on first run
- Include build artifacts or dependencies in scope
- Leave scope undefined (defaults to entire repository)
- Mix unrelated scopes in single excavation

**Example:**
```yaml
# Good: Focused scope
scopes:
  paths:
    include: ["cognitive_tribunal/modules/*.py"]
  analysis_types: [code_structure, documentation]

# Bad: Overly broad scope
scopes:
  paths:
    include: ["**/*"]  # Includes artifacts, cache, etc.
```

### 2. Output Management

**Do:**
- Enable dated subdirectories for output organization
- Choose appropriate detail levels for audience
- Persist memory notes for long-term context
- Use GitHub issues for actionable tasks

**Don't:**
- Generate all possible outputs for quick checks
- Mix findings from different scopes in same report
- Ignore memory notes from previous excavations
- Create duplicate issues for same findings

**Example:**
```yaml
# Good: Targeted outputs
outputs:
  tasks: { enabled: true, format: github_issues }
  memory: { enabled: true }
  reports: { enabled: true, detail_level: standard }

# Bad: Output overload
outputs:
  reports: { enabled: true, detail_level: comprehensive, formats: [markdown, json, html, pdf, xlsx] }
```

### 3. Nervousness Calibration

**Do:**
- Match nervousness to risk level of project
- Increase nervousness for security-critical code
- Use obsessive mode for compliance audits
- Lower nervousness for exploratory analysis

**Don't:**
- Use obsessive mode for routine checks (too slow)
- Use relaxed mode for security audits (too risky)
- Ignore agent concerns (they're usually valid)
- Disable verification in production environments

**Risk-Based Guidelines:**
- **Critical Systems (healthcare, finance):** High to Obsessive
- **Security Audits:** High to Obsessive
- **Production Releases:** Medium to High
- **Development Branches:** Standard to Medium
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Low to Standard

### 4. Iteration Strategy

**Do:**
- Start with full excavation for new repositories
- Use change detection for ongoing monitoring
- Run targeted digs for specific investigations
- Schedule regular anomaly hunting for maintenance

**Don't:**
- Re-run full excavation on every change
- Ignore change detection findings
- Skip regular security audits
- Defer technical debt indefinitely

**Recommended Cadence:**
- **Full Excavation:** Once per repository, at project start
- **Change Detection:** On every PR, continuous monitoring
- **Targeted Digs:** As needed for investigations
- **Anomaly Hunting:** Weekly (security), monthly (technical debt)

### 5. Integration with Workflow

**Do:**
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated checks
- Use pre-commit hooks for local validation
- Generate issues in project board swim lanes
- Link findings to epics and milestones

**Don't:**
- Block deployment on low-priority findings
- Overwhelm team with excessive issues
- Ignore findings in backlogs
- Run expensive excavations on every commit

**CI/CD Integration Example:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/nervous-archaeologist.yml
name: Repository Audit
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Nervous Archaeologist
        run: |
          @nervous-archaeologist Please run change detection for this PR
```

### 6. Memory Management

**Do:**
- Review and curate memory notes periodically
- Use memories to inform future analysis
- Share memories across team members
- Update memories when facts change

**Don't:**
- Let memory database grow unbounded
- Store sensitive data in memory notes
- Ignore outdated memories
- Delete memories without archiving

**Memory Hygiene:**
- Review memories monthly
- Flag outdated memories (don't delete)
- Archive superseded memories
- Categorize memories for easy retrieval

### 7. Collaboration

**Do:**
- Share excavation reports with stakeholders
- Discuss findings in team meetings
- Prioritize tasks collaboratively
- Provide context for recommendations

**Don't:**
- Generate reports in isolation
- Implement recommendations without review
- Assume all findings are correct
- Ignore domain expert feedback

**Communication Template:**
```markdown
## Excavation Findings Summary
**Date:** 2025-11-24
**Scope:** Security audit
**Agent:** nervous-archaeologist

**Key Findings:**
1. [High Priority] 3 dependency vulnerabilities
2. [Medium Priority] Missing SECURITY.md
3. [Low Priority] 12 PEP 8 style violations

**Next Steps:**
- Review high priority findings as team
- Assign issues to appropriate owners
- Schedule follow-up excavation after fixes

**Questions:**
- Should we adopt Dependabot for ongoing monitoring?
- What's our target timeline for governance documents?
```

### 8. Security Considerations

**Do:**
- Run security audits before releases
- Update dependencies proactively
- Create SECURITY.md for responsible disclosure
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities continuously

**Don't:**
- Publish security findings publicly before fixes
- Ignore low-severity vulnerabilities indefinitely
- Hard-code secrets in any files
- Disable security checks for convenience

**Security Workflow:**
1. Schedule regular security excavations
2. Triage findings by severity and exploitability
3. Fix critical and high severity issues immediately
4. Track medium/low severity in backlog
5. Re-scan after fixes to verify remediation

### 9. Performance Optimization

**Do:**
- Use change detection instead of full excavation when possible
- Exclude large binary files and artifacts
- Set reasonable depth limits for large repos
- Cache results when appropriate

**Don't:**
- Scan node_modules or vendor directories
- Re-analyze unchanged files unnecessarily
- Process files larger than needed
- Run multiple full excavations in parallel

**Performance Tuning:**
```yaml
# For large repositories (10,000+ files)
scopes:
  depth:
    max_directory_depth: 10
    max_file_size_mb: 5
  paths:
    exclude:
      - "**/node_modules/**"
      - "**/vendor/**"
      - "**/.git/**"

# Enable caching (if supported)
cache:
  enabled: true
  ttl_hours: 24
```

### 10. Continuous Improvement

**Do:**
- Review agent effectiveness periodically
- Adjust nervousness based on outcomes
- Refine scopes based on false positives
- Update memory notes with learnings

**Don't:**
- Blindly accept all recommendations
- Ignore patterns in false positives
- Keep using ineffective configurations
- Forget to celebrate caught issues

**Effectiveness Metrics:**
- **True Positive Rate:** Valid findings / total findings
- **False Positive Rate:** Invalid findings / total findings
- **Coverage:** Issues found / issues present (hard to measure)
- **Value:** Issues prevented / effort invested
